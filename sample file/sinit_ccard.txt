%-The parameters must be assigned with particular settings to be defined by users, and a null assignment will pause simulation running;
%-The parameter names cannot be modified, and must be followed immediately by"=", which is then only followed immediately by the setting;
%-Comments/explanations are started by "%", and cannot be in the same line as those for parameter assignment;
%-The scope for setting each array setting is delimited by ScopeBegin and ScopeEnd, any assignment out of the scope will not be processed;
%-Array index i (ArrIndi) can be expressed in batch as follows: i-j,k,m-p,h,t, which must be ended by '\0'. This experession is not applicable for Array index j (ArrIndj) of 2D array
%-One setting files can consist of multiple blcoks delimited by a pair of "{}", each corresponding to one array element.
