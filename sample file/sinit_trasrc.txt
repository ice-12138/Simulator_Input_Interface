%-All the following parameters must be assigned with particular settings to be defined by users. Any null assignment will pause simulation running.
%-The parameter names cannot be modified, and must be followed immediately by"=", which is then followed immediately by the setting only.
%-All comments/explanations are started by "%". and cannot be in the same line as those of parameter assignment.
